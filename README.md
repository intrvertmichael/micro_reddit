#### Vote on a Post
If you see a post you like Upvote it. If there is a post you do not like then Downvote it. You can vote once on every post and all votes will be counted together to give the total points on the post.

#### See posts in different Sort Order
Automatically all posts are shown in top order. Meaning the posts with the most points will be shown first. The points are calculated by subtracting the Downvotes from the total Upvotes. At the top of the page there are some other options for how to see the posts. You can see all the new posts first or show the Hot posts. Hot posts are calculated by taking the votes and dividing it by how much time has passed since voting. This means a post that was posted 5 seconds ago with 1 upvote will be shown before a post with 2 upvotes that was posted 5 hours ago.
